# ⚡ Bint

Bint is a Zig module for bounded integers —bints— defined by their minimum and maximum values.

It provides arithmetic operations safe from overflow/underflow through type-checking, and safe from division by zero and narrow-casting by type-checking when possible and by runtime regular Zig errors otherwise.
It also provides a few guaranteed optimizations (even in debug mode), like operations on "unique-values", _i.e._ bints whose minimum and maximum values are equal, are no-op even when they're operated at runtime.
